# next-p5-template

A template project to manage p5.js sketches. Built with Next.js.

### How to run

1. `npm install`
2. To develop, start the server using `npm run dev` and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

### How to make new sketch

1. Duplicate `sketches/dN.js` and rename it with a number starting with 1 (d1, d2 d3, etc.). The template already has d1.js, so just check that out.
2. Update `constants` to reflect total number of sketches.
3. Code!
